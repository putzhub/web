&lt;p&gt;This is my new web design &amp;amp; development portfolio!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've created a self-study program focusing on becoming a &lt;strong&gt;Full Stack Developer.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to learn more about that process, &lt;a href="https://web.putz.space/lessons-learned/self-teaching/"&gt;I wrote a post about creating my own web development curriculum.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this process in &lt;time datetime="2023-03"&gt;March of 2023&lt;/time&gt;, but I've been making websites for almost two decades now as a hobbyist. I was inspired to learn more about web development in a professional capacity and decided that it would work best for my schedule &amp;amp; personal commitments to teach myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it's just a matter of reading about and practicing the skills I need to work in a professional capacity. I'll be using the blog to share lessons I've learned as well, both to help others like myself and (hopefully) prove that I know what I'm talking about lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portfolio section is meant to showcase what work I've already done as you'd expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited to add more soon! Thanks for stopping by.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"/><category term="News"/></entry></feed>
