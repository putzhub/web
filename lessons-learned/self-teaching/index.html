<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I decided this spring that I want to become a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>. I looked around at coding bootcamps, but I felt that for my own schedule &amp; commitments that teaching myself would be most effective.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I decided to come up with my own path and <em>here's how!</em></p>
<h3>Table of Contents</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#goals">Start with Goals</a></li>
<li><a href="#path-to-full-stack">Path to Full Stack Development</a></li>
<li><a href="#sticking-with-it">Sticking with it</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="goals"></a></p>
<h2>Start with Goals</h2>
<p>The first step on this journey was to <strong>identify my goals</strong>. The focus on goals <strong>helps when important questions come up</strong>, which there are a lot of when you're on your own.</p>
<p>Personally, I've been interested in work from home jobs and flexible scheduling. I also like working on creative projects. A lot of this was already work I have been doing as a hobby, so I'm well situated to dive in deeper. Plus it'll make my already existing sites more sharp.</p>
<p><em>Long story short,</em> I landed on web development as a good investment of my time.</p>
<p><a name="path-to-full-stack"></a></p>
<h2>Path to Full Stack Development</h2>
<h3>The process</h3>
<p>The first step to actually making this all <em>happen</em> was to figure out the process from beginning to end.</p>
<p>It went something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Research and compile a typical curriculum for <strong>Full Stack Development</strong>.</li>
<li>Find suitable books to read.</li>
<li>Decide on which <strong>portfolio projects</strong> to make.</li>
<li>Keep focused and follow the timeframe.</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal is to be done in roughly 6 months to a year from when I started in March.</p>
<p>The timeframe for completing this is flexible since there's no way to really know how long it will take initially, but as I go it's easier to get a sense of how long I'll need to read books, work on projects, etc. Keeping an time log of hours spent on portfolio projects also helps.</p>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>For the curriculum iteslf, I landed on these units as the <em>important</em> areas to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#reading-fundamentals">Fundamentals &amp; Foundation</a></li>
<li><a href="#reading-web-design">Web Design</a></li>
<li><a href="#reading-javascript">Frameworks and Libraries</a></li>
<li><a href="#reading-backend">Databases and Backend</a></li>
<li><a href="#reading-security-deployment-operations">Security, Deployment and Operations</a></li>
<li><a href="#reading-workflow">Workflow and Nailing the Interview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Coming up with <strong>portfolio projects</strong> has been just a matter of looking at what areas of my own life have related needs that web design skills can actually solve. </p>
<p>My first project since starting, <a href="https://air.ludoloon.studio">Ludo Air</a>, is a combination of my love of flight sim and my already existing online studio, <a href="https://ludoloon.studio">LudoLoon Studio</a>.</p>
<p>This website of course serves as portfolio to show off my web progress. My next project I'm thinking of is a Social Media Dashboard since I'm sick of dealing with Instagram and Twitter directly lol.</p>
<h3>Reading List</h3>
<p>Here's a list of some books that I've either been reading, or will get around to reading by the end of my studies. </p>
<p>The most helpful ones (to me personally) are in bold. Some of these I had read previous to officially starting this project, but I went back and reviewed them to take notes.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: This evolves as I get through the books and sort which ones are actually useful or not.</em>

<h2>Sticking with it</h2>
<p>As you can imagine, the easy part is coming up with the roadmap. </p>
<p>In order to get through the curriculum it's important to have a <strong>schedule</strong>. I've been <strong>setting deadlines</strong> to make sure that I don't get stuck on one project and risk the whole effort getting sidetracked.</p>
<p><strong>Writing everything down is crucial</strong>. I use <a href="https://zim-wiki.org">Zim Wiki</a> which makes it easy to connect documents, but any good notetaking app will do.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Spreadsheets</em> for hours worked on projects.</li>
<li><em>Tasklists</em> for next steps.</li>
<li><em>Notes</em> of what you've read or planning projects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calendar reminders</strong> and <strong>keeping tasklists</strong> for when I have a moment to work remind me what steps I'm on currently or what I need to be reading.</p>
<p><strong>Staying well</strong> is crucial, which means taking breaks when burnt out and scheduling time to take care of yourself as well.</p>
<p><strong>Assessing study progress</strong> is an important process as milestones are acheived. This means deciding on next steps like what book to read next, framework to learn, or portfolio project to do.</p>
